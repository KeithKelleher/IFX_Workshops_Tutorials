##description<br>
RaMP-DB (Relational database of Metabolomic Pathways) is a multi-sourced integrated database with comprehensive annotations on biological pathways, structure/chemistry, disease and ontology annotations for genes, proteins, and metabolites. RaMP-DB also provides a framework for single and batch queries of those annotations, and for performing chemical and biological pathway enrichment analyses on input multi-omic datasets. Of note, users can input gene, protein, and metabolite IDs for queries and analyses.
